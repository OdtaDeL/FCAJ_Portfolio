This section covers **AWS Amplify** for frontend hosting and **Amazon Cognito** for user authentication:

### Amplify

**Role:** Build and deliver **Next.js** from a Git repository; configure build-time environment variables (for example NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL) so the browser calls the correct backend API.

**Why we chose it:** Managed CI/CD and HTTPS reduce the burden of operating your own static web/CDN stack; fits a monorepo when the frontend app root is explicit. For **Next.js**, a pure static **S3 + CloudFront** pattern is often **more cumbersome** because the framework may use **SSR** (server-side rendering).

### Cognito

**Role:** **User Pool** and **App client** for sign-up, sign-in, and issuing tokens; optional **Lambda triggers** (for example **PostConfirmation** syncing users into RDS).

**Why we chose it:** Fully managed authentication, standard **JWTs**, and integration with the frontend and Lambda — no need to build and run a dedicated auth server. Strong efficiency and flexible **scaling** as usage grows.
